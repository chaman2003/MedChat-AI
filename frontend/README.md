# Frontend - Independent Full Stack

## Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run
```bash
npm start
# Opens browser at http://localhost:5000
```

Or:
```bash
npm run serve
# Just starts server, no browser open
```

## Environment

Frontend connects to backend at: `http://localhost:3001`

Update in `js/app.js` if backend is on different port/host.
